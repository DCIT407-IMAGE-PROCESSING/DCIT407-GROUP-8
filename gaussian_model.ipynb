   "source": "## 1. What is a Probability Distribution?\n\nIn real-world imaging sensors, every pixel measurement contains a small **random error**. These errors come from thermal fluctuations in sensor electronics, photon shot noise, and electronic readout noise.\n\nThese errors are **random** — but not completely shapeless. They follow a pattern:\n- Small errors are **common**\n- Large errors are **rare**\n- Very large errors are **extremely rare**\n\nA **probability distribution** is a mathematical function that describes how likely different noise values are to occur. Instead of saying *'the noise can be anything'*, a distribution gives shape and structure to the randomness.\n\n> 💡 **Key Intuition:** A distribution tells us where values tend to cluster and how spread out they are. The Gaussian distribution says: errors near zero are most common, and the further from zero, the rarer they become."

The Gaussian (Normal) Distribution\n\nThe **Gaussian distribution** — also called the **Normal distribution** — is the most widely used probability distribution in science and engineering. It produces the famous **bell-shaped curve**.\n\nIt is completely defined by just **two parameters**:\n\n| Parameter | Symbol | Role |\n|-----------|--------|------|\n| Mean | μ (mu) | The center / peak of the bell curve |\n| Variance | σ² (sigma squared) | The width / spread of the bell curve |\n\n---\n\n### 2.1 The Probability Density Function (PDF)\n\nThe shape of the Gaussian is given by its **Probability Density Function (PDF)**. This function tells us: *for a given noise value $x$, how likely is that value to occur?*\n\n$$\nf(x \\mid \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\; e^{\\displaystyle -\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 Breaking Down the Formula\n\n| Component | Symbol | Meaning |\n|-----------|--------|---------|\n| Random variable | $x$ | The specific noise value being evaluated (e.g. a pixel error of +5) |\n| Mean | $\\mu$ | The center of the distribution. For image noise: usually $\\mu = 0$ |\n| Variance | $\\sigma^2$ | Controls the spread. Large $\\sigma^2$ → wide, flat curve → more intense noise |\n| Standard deviation | $\\sigma$ | Square root of variance. Same units as $x$ (e.g. pixel intensity) |\n| Euler's number | $e \\approx 2.718$ | Creates the smooth, exponentially decaying tails of the curve |\n| Normalization factor | $\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$ | Ensures total area under the curve = 1 (total probability = 100%) |\n| Exponent | $-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}$ | Measures how far $x$ is from the mean, scaled by the spread |\n\n> 📌 **Note:** The exponent is always **negative**, so as $x$ moves further from $\\mu$, the exponent becomes more negative, and $e^{\\text{negative number}}$ shrinks toward zero — this is what creates the tails of the bell curve."

   "source": "---\n## 3. Mean (μ) — The Center of Noise\n\nThe **mean** $\\mu$ is the average value around which noise fluctuates. It sits at the exact **peak** of the bell curve — the most likely value to be observed.\n\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i\n$$\n\nwhere $n_i$ are individual noise samples and $N$ is the total number of samples.\n\n---\n\n### 3.1 Why μ = 0 for Image Noise\n\nIn image processing, Gaussian noise is almost always modeled with **zero mean** ($\\mu = 0$). This reflects a physical reality:\n\n- Sensor noise doesn't systematically **brighten** or **darken** pixels\n- It randomly fluctuates **upward and downward in equal measure**\n- On average, no net brightness is added to the image — only random scatter\n\n> 💡 **Example:** If $\\mu = 0$ and $\\sigma = 25$, then a noise value of $+15$ and a noise value of $-15$ are equally probable. The image is randomly corrupted, but not biased toward brightness or darkness.\n\n---\n\n### 3.2 Effect of Changing μ\n\n| Mean (μ) | Curve Position | Practical Effect on Image |\n|----------|---------------|---------------------------|\n| $\\mu = 0$ | Centered at zero | Noise adds and subtracts equally — unbiased |\n| $\\mu > 0$ (e.g. +30) | Shifted right | Noise systematically **brightens** pixels |\n| $\\mu < 0$ (e.g. −30) | Shifted left | Noise systematically **darkens** pixels |"

   "source": "---\n## 4. Variance (σ²) and Standard Deviation (σ)\n\n**Variance** $\\sigma^2$ measures how widely the noise values are spread around the mean. It is the most important parameter for controlling **noise intensity** in simulations.\n\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (n_i - \\mu)^2\n$$\n\n**Standard deviation** $\\sigma$ is the square root of variance:\n\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}\n$$\n\nStandard deviation is expressed in the **same units as the pixel values** (0–255 for 8-bit images), making it more intuitive to interpret than variance.\n\n---\n\n### 4.1 Why We Square in the Variance Formula\n\nThe deviations $(n_i - \\mu)$ can be positive or negative. If we simply averaged them, positive and negative errors would cancel each other out to zero. By **squaring** them:\n- Both positive and negative errors contribute **positively** to variance\n- Larger errors are weighted **more heavily**\n- The result is a true measure of average spread\n\n---\n\n### 4.2 Visualizing Variance\n\n> 💡 **Analogy:** Think of variance as the energy of the noise.\n> - **Low σ²** → gentle ripples on a calm lake → slight graininess in the image\n> - **High σ²** → violent storm waves → heavy noise, image details obscured\n\n| Noise Level | Std. Dev. (σ) | Variance (σ²) | Visual Impact |\n|-------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Very Low    | σ = 5        | σ² = 25       | Barely perceptible |\n| Low         | σ = 15       | σ² = 225      | Slight graininess |\n| Medium      | σ = 25       | σ² = 625      | Clearly visible noise |\n| High        | σ = 50       | σ² = 2,500    | Heavy noise, details lost |\n| Very High   | σ = 100      | σ² = 10,000   | Image nearly unrecognizable |\n\n---\n\n### 4.3 How σ Shapes the Bell Curve\n\nThe standard deviation $\\sigma$ directly controls the **width** of the bell curve:\n\n- **Small $\\sigma$** → tall, narrow peak → noise values tightly clustered around the mean\n- **Large $\\sigma$** → short, wide, flat curve → noise values spread far from the mean\n\nBoth curves integrate to the same total area = 1, since probability must always sum to 100%."

   "source": "---\n## 6. The Gaussian Noise Equation\n\nNow we bring everything together into the **complete noise model** used in image processing.\n\n---\n\n### 6.1 Additive Noise Model\n\nGaussian noise is modeled as **additive** — the noise value is directly added on top of the clean pixel:\n\n$$\nI_{\\text{noisy}}(x, y) = I_{\\text{original}}(x, y) + n(x, y)\n$$\n\n| Symbol | Meaning |\n|--------|---------|\n| $I_{\\text{noisy}}(x, y)$ | Observed (corrupted) pixel intensity at position $(x, y)$ |\n| $I_{\\text{original}}(x, y)$ | True (clean) pixel intensity at position $(x, y)$ |\n| $n(x, y)$ | Noise value at pixel $(x, y)$, sampled from a Gaussian distribution |\n\n---\n\n### 6.2 The Noise Term\n\nThe noise $n(x, y)$ at each pixel is **independently** sampled from the Gaussian distribution:\n\n$$\nn(x, y) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\n$$\n\nThe symbol $\\sim$ means **'is drawn from'** or **'follows the distribution of'**. Each pixel gets a **fresh, independent** random noise sample — no two pixels share the same noise value.\n\n---\n\n### 6.3 Complete Gaussian Noise Model\n\nCombining both equations gives us the full model:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{I_{\\text{noisy}}(x, y) = I_{\\text{original}}(x, y) + \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\, \\sigma^2)}\n$$\n\n> 📌 **Standard Assumption:** Set $\\mu = 0$ (zero-mean, unbiased noise). The only tuning parameter is $\\sigma^2$ — increasing it makes the image noisier.\n\n---\n\n### 6.4 Pixel Clipping\n\nPixel intensities must stay within the valid range **[0, 255]** for 8-bit images. After adding noise, we apply clipping:\n\n$$\nI_{\\text{noisy}}(x, y) = \\text{clip}\\!\\left(I_{\\text{original}}(x, y) + n(x, y),\\; 0,\\; 255\\right)\n$$\n\nWithout clipping:\n- Bright pixel (e.g. 240) + positive noise (+30) → **270** → overflow ❌\n- Dark pixel (e.g. 10) + negative noise (−25) → **−15** → underflow ❌\n\nWith clipping, both are snapped back to the valid [0, 255] range ✅\n\n---\n\n### 6.5 Why Gaussian Noise is a Good Model\n\n| Reason | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Central Limit Theorem** | Real sensor noise is the sum of many independent effects. By the CLT, their sum converges to a Gaussian — by mathematical law |\n| **Separability** | A 2D Gaussian filter splits into two 1D passes, making it computationally efficient |\n| **Mathematical tractability** | Gaussian distributions have clean, closed-form formulas easy to analyze and compute |\n| **Maximum entropy** | For a fixed mean and variance, the Gaussian makes the fewest assumptions — the most natural model under uncertainty |"
